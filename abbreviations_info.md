Abbreviations information 
=====================================

Token     |     Description
--------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
XYZ       |     Used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
t         |     Indicate Time domain signals
f         |     Indicate Frecuency domain signals
Body      |     Signal based on the body of an experiment participant, one of two components derived from the time based signals on the phones's accelerometer 
Freq      |     Measurement based on the frequency domain, taken as a Fast Fourier Transform on the time-based signals
Gravity   |     Signal based on gravity, the force that attracts a body towards the center of the earth. Gravity is the second of the measurements  components derived form the phones's accelerometer
Acc       |     Accelerometer
Gyro      |     Gyroscope
Jerk      |     Jerk signals obtained by deriving in time the body linear acceleration and angular velocity 
Mag       |     Magnitude of these three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag)
